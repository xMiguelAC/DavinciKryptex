# Davinci Kryptex

Davinci Kryptex is a web application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using a custom alphabet algorithm. This tool provides a simple yet effective way to secure your messages with a classical cryptographic method.

## Project Description

Davinci Kryptex uses a substitution cipher approach to encrypt text. Each letter in the original message is replaced with a different letter according to a predefined algorithm. This type of encryption is inspired by historical ciphers while being implemented in a modern web interface.

The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible through any modern web browser without requiring any server-side processing.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Convert your plain text into an encrypted format
- **Text Decryption**: Decode previously encrypted messages
- **Alphabet-based Algorithm**: Uses a custom substitution method for encryption
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for easy use
- **Client-side Processing**: All encryption happens in your browser for privacy

## How to Use

1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt in the input field
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to convert your text
4. Copy the encrypted result to share with others
5. To decrypt, paste an encrypted message and click "Decrypt"

## Installation

No installation is required to use Davinci Kryptex. Simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xMiguelAC/DavinciKryptex.git
cd DavinciKryptex
```

Then open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Security Note

While Davinci Kryptex provides a fun way to encode messages, please note that this type of encryption is not suitable for securing sensitive information. The substitution cipher used in this application is primarily educational and should not be used for truly confidential communications.
